# Kaplan‚Äôs MacOS Setup

I've found myself sending my tips and configurations to friends and colleagues so many times, I decided to create this repo to make it easier for me to share my setup.

This is a guide for people who are new to Mac, or for people who are looking for a better setup.

This is a work in progress, I will add more stuff as I go.

## If you are unfamiliar with Mac

What you need to know:

- Full screen apps sucks, don‚Äôt press the green maximize button.
- Almost everything you used to use `Ctrl` for, is now `Cmd`
- `Home` + `End` (goto start / end of line) ‚Üí `Cmd + Arrow keys`
- Switch language ‚Üí The default is `Ctrl + Space`, I suggest changing it to `Option + Space` since `Ctrl + Space` is reserved for vscode autocompletion.
- Don‚Äôt use the dock to launch apps, get used to do everything with Spotlight (default) or Raycast (recommended) by pressing `Cmd+Space`
- `Cmd + W` closes windows, `Cmd + Q` closes apps
    - Apps can stay open even when there are no windows
        
        Its common to open an app (say, WhatsApp) and close its windows, the app will remain open, it just won‚Äôt have any windows.
        
- Finder (mac‚Äôs version of `Explorer.exe`) sucks, don‚Äôt use it unless you have to, prefer using the terminal.
  - If using my configuration, use `br` to find directories.
- When you are in terminal - you can use `open <path>` to open the path in finder / default app for this file.
    - For example, I can open the current working directory by entering `open .`
    - Or open an image using `open myimage.png`

    - Key repeat rate to Fastest

### Raycast
After you install Raycast, remove the Spotlight keybinding, and bind Raycast to cmd+space
You can bind commands to key shortcuts from the raycast menu.

I recommend binding the following commands to a key shortcut:
| Name                           | Shortcut                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Clipboard History              | `cmd + shift + space`   |
| Search Emoji & Symbols         | `ctrl + cmd + space`    |
| Window Management / Left Half  | `ctrl + option + left`  |
| Window Management / Right Half | `ctrl + option + right` |
| Window Management / Maximize   | `ctrl + option + up`    |
